## Introduction

Shove's Laravel package provides a simple way to integrate Shove's
queuing and scheduling features into your Laravel application.
Shove's Laravel package includes a queue driver that allows you to
send jobs to your Laravel application using Shove's infrastructure.

## Why Use Shove with Laravel?

Laravel comes with an incredibly powerful queue system that allows you
to offload processing of time-consuming tasks to the background. This
is useful for workflows like sending emails, processing payments, and
more.

One of the downsides of using Laravel's queue system is that it
requires you to run separate infrastructure to handle the jobs
themselves, whether that's Redis, Amazon SQS, or another queue
software. Using Shove, you don't need to manage this infrastructure
yourself, yet you retain the ability to use Laravel's queue
system to process your background tasks.

In addition, you gain the ability to schedule your Laravel jobs
far into the future and to create _recurring jobs_, giving you even
more flexibility when building your application.

## Setting Up A Queue

Before Shove can send jobs to your Laravel application, you need to
create a queue to receive those jobs. We recommend creating your first
queue via the Shove dashboard, but you can also create a queue using the
included PHP library for Shove's API.

### Creating a New Queue Using the Shove Dashboard

To create a new queue in the Shove dashboard, visit the Queues page and
click `Create Queue`. You will be presented with a form to specify the
name and type of your new queue, along with the type. When using
Shove's Laravel driver, this should be a _unicast_ queue.

<Info>While we recommend using a unicast queue with a single worker for
    most Laravel applications, you may also configure your queue as a
    multicast queue. This allows jobs to be handled by multiple workers
    at once (which can be at a completely different server) allowing you
    more flexibility in processing a single job.</Info>

### Creating a New Queue Using the Shove PHP Library

```php
use Shove\ShoveConnector;

$shove = new ShoveConnector('your-api-key');
$shove->queues->create('default', 'unicast');
```

### Adding a Worker to Your Queue

With your queue created, you can now add a worker to your queue. A
worker is a URL that Shove will send jobs to.

Inside your new queue's detail page, find the Worker section and
click the `Create Worker` button. You will be presented with a form to
add a new
worker to your queue. Specify the URL you intend to use to handle
incoming jobs from Shove.

<Info>
    You must have a public URL for Shove to send jobs to. If you are
    running
    your Laravel application locally, you can use a service
    like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create a public URL for your
    local
    server.
</Info>

With your new queue and worker created, you are ready to set up your
Laravel application to receive jobs from Shove!

## Setting Up Laravel

### 1. Install `shovedev/shove-laravel`

```sh
composer require shovedev/shove-laravel
```

#### Optional: Publish the configuration file

```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Shove\Laravel\ShoveServiceProvider"
```

### 2. Set Up Your Incoming Webhook Endpoint

Shove sends jobs to your Laravel application using HTTP, so you need to
define the route Shove will use to send jobs inside your
Laravel routes. This endpoint should be publicly accessible, free from
any authentication. Thankfully, Shove includes the `routes` method
to make this a breeze.


```php routes/web.php
<?php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

// Laravel's default route
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

// Set up your incoming Shove endpoint. By default
// Shove will send jobs to the `/shove` endpoint.
Shove::routes('/shove');

// Other authenticated routes. For example from Laravel Jetstream...
Route::middleware([
    'auth:sanctum', config('jetstream.auth_session'), 'verified',
])->group(function () {
    Route::view('dashboard', 'dashboard')->name('dashboard');
});
```


<Info>
    Feel free to use a custom endpoint for your incoming Shove jobs.
    Just
    remember to configure your queue’s worker to use that URL.
</Info>

## 3. Define Your Environment Variables

To verify incoming jobs are actually from Shove, Shove includes a
`Shove-Signature` header when delivering a job to the worker's
endpoint. The signature is a sha256 hash of the request body, signed
using your signing secret.

The Laravel package handles this verification by default, but you should
ensure the following environment variables are included:


```sh .env
SHOVE_API_KEY=your-api-key
SHOVE_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
```


## 4. Disable CSRF Protection For Shove

By default, Laravel protects your application from cross-site request
forgeries. Laravel automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each
active user session and verifies it during each request.

Since Shove does not use application sessions, you need to disable this
protection for your queue's worker endpoint.

To do this, follow the Laravel framework’s documentation
for [Excluding URIs from CSRF Protection](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/csrf#csrf-excluding-uris).

<Info>
    If you’re using Laravel 11, Shove handles disabling CSRF
    verification
    automatically.

## Queueing Jobs With Shove

Imagine you have an API controller that accepts a `name`,
`description`, and a `file`. After storing the episode in your database,
you want to process the episode in the background to avoid making
the user wait for the episode to process, risking a timeout.

To queue a job with Shove, you can use Laravel's built-in `dispatch`
helper to queue jobs.

```php app/Http/Controllers/PodcastController.php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\API;

use App\Jobs\ProcessPodcastEpisode;
use App\Models\Episode;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class PodcastStoreController extends Controller
{
    public function __invoke(Request $request)
    {
        $request->validate([
            'name' => 'required|string',
            'description' => 'required|string',
            'file' => 'required|file',
        ]);

        $episode = Episode::create([
            'name' => $request->input('name'),
            'description' => $request->input('description'),
            'file' => $request->file('file')->store('podcasts'),
        ]);

        dispatch(new ProcessPodcastEpisode($episode))
            ->onConnection('shove')
            ->onQueue('podcasts');

        return response()->json(['message' => 'Podcast queued for processing']);
    }
}
```

Because we've set up our Laravel application to receive jobs from
Shove, the `ProcessPodcastEpisode` job will be sent to the worker
endpoint we defined in `routes/web.php` using `Shove::routes`. Shove
will then process the job using the `handle` method from our
`ProcessPodcastEpisode` job class.
