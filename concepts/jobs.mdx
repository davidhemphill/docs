In Shove, jobs are a way to run application tasks in the background.
You can create jobs using the dashboard, using Shove's client
libraries or integrations, or via the API.
They are useful for tasks that are too slow to run during a web request,
tasks that need to be run at a specific time, or for tasks that need
to be ran at regular intervals.

Shove makes it easy to handle these background tasks by notifying
your application via HTTP when a job should be run. This allows you
to focus on only doing the work you need to do, and running the
queuing infrastructure.

## How Jobs Are Handled

Jobs are essentially a JSON-encoded payload that is stored inside
Shove. They are added to a queue, where they are stored until
they're ready to be sent to your application.

When a job is ready to be run, Shove will send an HTTP POST request
to each of the endpoints you've configured for your workers.
