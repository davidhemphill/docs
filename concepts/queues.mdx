Queues receive Jobs and have many workers. They can be configured to
use
either a multicast or unicast strategy.

### Unicast Queues (default)

When using unicast queues, Shove will send a job to a single random
worker. This allows each job to be processed only once by a single
worker.

### Multicast Queues

When using a multicast queue, Shove will push a job to all workers.
This
allows for a parallel processing of each job where each worker can
handle a job differently.

For example, let's pretend you have a job where a user uploads a CSV
file to your service. You could have two workers: one that handles
generating a report from the CSV, and another worker that sends an admin
an email notifying them of the new upload. Using this workflow allows
for quicker processing, since the separate tasks would be handled in
parallel.
